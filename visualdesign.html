	<h2> Artifact #1 &nbsp;</h2>
<img src="artifacts/moodboard.png" width="420" height="257" alt=""/>
	<p> During quarantine, I had an unhealthy Sims4 obsession and i wanted to be a pro sims maker and download all the custom content I wanted, and had a phase where I wanted to cook different recipes which is funny because they were not anything out of the ordinary. It's just Mac and cheese and chicken nuggets. We were instructed to create a vision board for all the goals we wanted to achieve and these are just some of the things i wanted to acheieve at the time. . &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; </p><h2>Artifact #2</h2>

	<p>  We were instructed to craete any piece of work but it had to be photoshopped. I already liked grpahic designing so this was very fun for me. At the time I was obsessed with Ariana grande so I created an edit for her based on her aesthetic at the time. </p>
	<h2>Artifact #3</h2>

<p> I wanted to make something humorus for this specific assignment. There was no sentimental or creative intent behind this work in all honesty. However, headphones on a teddy bear is obviously not something you would see regualry which is what makes this piece sooo hilarious. This stuffed animal was actually gifted to me by a friend and my headphones are something I cannot live without so, I unintentionally put two very meaningful things that are little pieces of who I am in one picture.  </p>
	<h2>Artifact #4</h2>

	<p> Here we were asssigned to recreate album covers so I decided to do two very successful albums and recreate it to the vibe I felt it leaned towards wuthout taking away from the original creation</p>
	<h2>Artifact #5</h2>
